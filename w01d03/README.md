# W01D03 - Objects in JS

### To Do
- [x] Review primitive types
- [x] Objects!
- [x] Passing primitives and objects to functions
- [x] Functions inside objects (using `this`)
- [x] Object iteration with `for..in`

Use for..of with everything except objects, because `Of` and `Object` boths start with `O`

coffee, waterfall, lighthouse, chopping vegetables, random

### Primitives
* strings
* booleans
* number
* null
* undefined
* Symbol
* bigint

const name = 'Alice';

* not an object
* stored directly in memory
* they are immutable (cannot be changed)



* primitives are passed by reference (which means the function gets a copy/not the original)
