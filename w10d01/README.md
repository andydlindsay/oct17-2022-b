# W10D01 - Rails Review

### To Do
- [x] "Rails Week" Conversation
- [x] MVC Review
- [x] Quickly build simple Rails app
- [x] Nested Resources
- [x] `scaffold` command

### Rails week convo
* some things were out of order (instructions specific for M1)
* ORM was added (new)
* not used to magic
* working within a framework
* learning the magic is turbulent
* setup was already pre-made
* not understanding the why

### MVC
* Model - data
* View - template, ERB, rendering out HTML
* Controller - brains of the operation
